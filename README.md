# 🔍 Tokenized Peer-Review System

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution for academic and scientific publishing! This project addresses the real-world problem of inefficient, uncompensated peer review in traditional systems, where reviewers often provide low-quality feedback due to lack of incentives, leading to delays, biases, and poor research quality. By tokenizing the process on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, we reward reviewers for high-quality contributions, encourage participation, and ensure transparent, immutable evaluations. Creators submit works, reviewers earn tokens based on community-voted quality, and the system fosters a merit-based ecosystem.

## ✨ Features

💰 Reward reviewers with native tokens for insightful, high-quality reviews  
📄 Immutable submission and review records on the blockchain  
🗳 Community voting to assess review quality and prevent spam  
🔒 Staking mechanism to ensure reviewer accountability (slash stakes for poor reviews)  
📊 Governance for adjusting reward parameters and system rules  
✅ Automated reward distribution based on verified contributions  
🚫 Dispute resolution for contested reviews or submissions  
🌐 Decentralized user registry for verified participants  

## 🛠 How It Works

The system is built around 8 core Clarity smart contracts that interact seamlessly to manage the peer-review lifecycle. Here's a high-level overview:

**For Authors**  
- Register via UserRegistry.clar.  
- Submit your work using SubmissionContract.clar (provide a content hash for IP protection).  
- Once reviewed, view aggregated feedback and approve publication if criteria are met.  

**For Reviewers**  
- Register and stake tokens to qualify (via UserRegistry and RewardDistribution).  
- Get assigned via ReviewAssignment.clar.  
- Submit reviews through ReviewSubmission.clar.  
- Earn rewards after QualityVoting.clar confirms high quality—tokens are minted and transferred automatically.  

**For Voters/Community**  
- Stake to participate in QualityVoting.clar.  
- Vote on reviews to influence rewards and maintain system integrity.  
- Propose upgrades via GovernanceContract.clar.  

This setup solves incentive misalignment in peer review by gamifying contributions, reducing biases through transparency, and scaling via blockchain. Deploy on Stacks for low-cost, secure transactions—start building today!
